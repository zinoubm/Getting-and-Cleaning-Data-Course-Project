### **Experiment Description**
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers were selected for generating the training data and 30% for the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

### **Data Set Description**

* The data set produced by the script in this project has been obtained by the following:
  + Merging the train and test data from the original data set.
  + Extracting the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  + Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
  + Labeling the data set with descriptive variable names.
  + Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


### **Variables**

* Units:
  + Gravity : g
  + Angular velocity : radians/second
  
* Values Range:
  + All the numeric measurements are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
  + Subject is in the range of 1 to 30.
